**Key Features:**
- Real camera trap image sequences from wildlife research
- Hierarchical scoring system (10 points for species, 5 for genus, 3 for family, etc.)
- Autocomplete search supporting both scientific and common names
- AI-generated hints and "fun facts"
- High score leaderboard
- Responsive web interface optimized for learning

The game serves as both an educational tool for wildlife identification and a fun way to test your knowledge of animal taxonomy. Whether you're a wildlife enthusiast, student, or researcher, the game adapts to your knowledge level - you can guess broadly (family) or specifically (species) and still earn points.

Built using real data from camera trap research projects, this game connects players with ongoing wildlife conservation efforts while building taxonomic knowledge and identification skills.

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Initialize database**:
   ```bash
   python db_setup.py
   ```

3. **Populate database from CSV**:
   ```bash
   python data_processor.py --csv-path /path/to/your/camera-trap-data.csv
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Detailed Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- At least 2GB available disk space (for database)
- Your wildlife camera trap CSV file

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure all project files are in your working directory
   ls
   # Should show: app.py, models.py, game_logic.py, data_processor.py, etc.
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment (recommended)**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv wildlife-game-env
   source wildlife-game-env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   wildlife-game-env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Database Setup

#### Step 1: Initialize Database Schema
```bash
python db_setup.py
```

This creates `camera_trap_data.db` with the required tables:
- `taxa` - Unique taxonomic combinations
- `sequences` - Camera trap image sequences  
- `images` - Individual image metadata
- `high_scores` - Game leaderboard

#### Step 2: Process CSV Data
```bash
python data_processor.py --csv-path /path/to/your/camera-trap-data.csv
```

**Important**: Use the exact path to your CSV file. For example:
```bash
# If CSV is in the same directory:
python data_processor.py --csv-path ./camera_trap_data.csv

# If CSV is elsewhere:
python data_processor.py --csv-path /home/user/data/camera_trap_data.csv
```

**Processing Details**:
- Filters out non-wildlife images (blank taxonomy columns)
- Creates unique taxa entries
- Groups images into sequences
- Can take 10-30 minutes for large CSV files
- Shows progress updates during processing

#### Step 3: Verify Database Population
```bash
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('camera_trap_data.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM taxa')
taxa_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sequences') 
seq_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
cursor.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM images')
img_count = cursor.fetchone()[0]
print(f'Database populated with:')
print(f'  Taxa: {taxa_count:,}')
print(f'  Sequences: {seq_count:,}')
print(f'  Images: {img_count:,}')
conn.close()
"
```

### Running the Application

### AI Features Setup (Optional)

For hints and fun facts features:

1. **Get Gemini API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. **Provide the API key** using one of these methods (in order of priority):

   **Option A: Environment Variable**
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   **Option B: .env File**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

   **Option C: .gemini-key File**
   Create a `.gemini-key` file in the project root:
   ```
   your-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Restart the application** - AI features will now be available:
   - **Hints**: Click the "ðŸ’¡ Get Hint" button during gameplay for identification clues
   - **Fun Facts**: Automatically generated facts appear after each correct identification

**Note**: Add `.env` and `.gemini-key` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing API keys to version control.

## Configuration Options

### Game Settings (app.py)
```python
# Modify these variables in app.py:
QUESTIONS_PER_GAME = 10    # Number of taxa per game
SEQUENCES_PER_QUESTION = 4  # Image sequences shown per question
IMAGE_CLOUD_PREFERENCE = 'gcp'  # 'gcp', 'aws', or 'azure'
```

### Database Location
```python
# In models.py, change DATABASE_PATH if needed:
DATABASE_PATH = 'camera_trap_data.db'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No module named 'flask'"
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### "Database file not found"
```bash
# Run database setup first:
python db_setup.py
```

#### "No data found" during CSV processing
- Check CSV file path is correct
- Ensure CSV has the expected column headers
- Verify CSV contains wildlife data (non-blank taxonomy columns)

#### Images not loading
- Check internet connection (images hosted on cloud)
- Verify CSV contained valid image URLs
- Try changing `IMAGE_CLOUD_PREFERENCE` in app.py

#### High memory usage
- Large databases may use significant RAM
- Consider upgrading VM if processing very large datasets
- Monitor with `htop` or similar during CSV processing

### Performance Optimization

#### Slow autocompletion
```sql
-- Add additional indexes if needed:
sqlite3 camera_trap_data.db
CREATE INDEX idx_taxa_search ON taxa(common_name, most_specific_name);
```

#### Slow game loading
```python
# In models.py, increase cache size:
conn.execute('PRAGMA cache_size = 10000')
```

### Log Files

Check application logs for detailed error information:
```bash
# Run with logging:
python app.py 2>&1 | tee app.log
```

## Support

For issues with this implementation:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify your CSV file format matches the expected schema
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Check that you have sufficient disk space and memory

The system is designed to be simple and robust, but wildlife camera trap data can be complex. If you encounter issues with your specific dataset, the most common cause is unexpected data formatting in the CSV file.
